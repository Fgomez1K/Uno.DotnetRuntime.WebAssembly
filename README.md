# Uno Platform - .NET Runtime fork

This repository is the home of the [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) fork for the [Uno Platform](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno).

It contains adjustments over the official runtime for the Uno Platform in order to enable or disable specific features for the WebAssembly runtime (e.g. enabling AOT, IDBFS, etc...).

It is packaged to be used along with the [Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.wasm.bootstrap) nuget package.
